# Input-Oriented Envelopment Model

## Introduction

```{r, include=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
library(bookdown); library(rmarkdown); rmarkdown::render("02-IO_Env.Rmd", "pdf_book")
```

\index{Data envelopment analysis|(} Data envelopment analysis or DEA is a powerful tool for conducting studies of \index{Efficiency} efficiency and has been used in thousands of publications since its inception in the 1970s.

While tools exist for conducting the evaluations, it is important to understand how the tools work. Many DEA studies have been conducted and published by authors with only a superficial understanding of the technique. This is equivalent to having a house built by carpenters who barely understand how to use a hammer. The purpose of this document is to explain what DEA is, demonstrate how it works, and how to use R for getting started with DEA. In order to keep things simple, the first step only looks at the \index{Input-oriented} input-oriented \index{Envelopment model} envelopment model with \index{Constant returns to scale} \index{CRS|see{Constant returns to scale}} \index{Constant returns to scale|(} constant returns to scale. We will consider other models soon.

This chapter walks through how DEA works and then shows how to implement the model in R using two very different approaches. Over the years, I have built DEA models in many languages and platforms: Pascal, LINDO, LINGO, Excel Macros, Excel VBA, GAMS, AMPL, XPress-MOSEL, and GLPK among others.

Recently, my research group at PSU adopted the R platform based on the following strengths:

-   Open-source so that people can dive as deep as they need and no risk of future vendor lock-in
-   Freely available so it does not strain research budgets
-   Extensive collection of numerical add-in packages (over 15,000 at \index{CRAN} CRAN) to build upon
-   Robust distribution of add-in packages helps improve distribution of our own contributions
-   Multiple linear programming packages to choose from
-   Widespread usage and acceptance in the research and analytics communities
-   No arbitrary capacity limits
-   One platform that combines optimization and statistical analysis

## An Illustrative Example

DEA typically has \index{Inputs} inputs and \index{Outputs} outputs. The input(s) are typically resources that are consumed in the production of output(s). Inputs are referred to as "bads" in that higher levels at the same level of output is considered worse. Similarly, holding everything else constant, an increase in any single output is laudable. Examples of inputs might include capital, labor, or number of machines.

In contrast, outputs are the "good" items that are being produced by the actions of the producers. Examples of outputs might include automobiles produced, customers served, or graduating students. \index{Data envelopment analysis|)}

Let's start by creating a simple application. Assume that you are a regional manager of a grocery chain. You have four stores and would like to assess the performance of the store managers using the number of employees, *x*, as an input and the weekly sales, *y*, as an output.

As the manager responsible for the stores in the region, there are many questions that you may want answered:

-   Which of these stores are the best?
-   Which stores are laggards?
-   For those that are under performing, are there objective performance targets they should be able to reach?
-   Which stores might be employing \index{Best practices} best practices that could be adopted by other stores?
-   Among the stores that are lagging in performance, are there particular stores they should focus attention on for learning best practices?

We'll start by drawing a visual representation of the \index{Input-output model} input-output model. The function \index{TRA!DrawIOdiagram} `DrawIOdiagram` is from the \index{TRA!Package} `TRA` package and allows for creating a nicely formatted input-output diagram. For those that are new to `R`, it is important to load each package before its use using the `library` command. The library command loads it into memory but the package must be installed first. Most packages are available on \index{CRAN} CRAN and can be \index{Install packages} installed from CRAN by using `install.packages` command. RStudio makes it easier by just clicking on the install button in the IDE. The `TRA` package is instead just available on github. To install it, you will need a package, `remotes`, which can then be used to install a package directly from github. \vspace{12pt}

```{r DEA-IO-Plot1, eval=TRUE, out.width="50%", fig.align='center', fig.cap="A Simple DEA Model for Store Management"}
library (TRA) # Note, may need to install directly from github
              # remotes::install_github("prof-anderson/TRA")
library (DiagrammeR)
library (DiagrammeRsvg)
library (rsvg)
Figure <- DrawIOdiagram (c("Employees\n(FTE)" ), 
                         c("Sales\n($/week)"), 
                         c("\nStore\n"))
tmp<-capture.output(rsvg_png(charToRaw(export_svg(Figure)),
                             'generated-images/DEA_IO_stores.PNG')) 
knitr::include_graphics("generated-images/DEA_IO_stores.PNG")

```

The figure for drawing \index{Input-output diagram} input-output diagrams is worth a little discussion and explanation.

This follows three steps to work for both HTML & PDF:

1.  Generate diagram object and save to Figure object
2.  Export Figure as image to images directory
3.  Display image

A few other things to note from reading the previous code chunk:

1.  It assumes that there is a subdirectory for images - if there isn't a subdirectory for images, you can create one or edit the path in the code. I created a subdirectory `generated-images` to highlight that these are images that I am creating through R and do not need to be permanently stored in the github repository.
2.  The text passed to the function such as `"Sales\n($/week)"` allows for a line return character such as `"\n"`. This allows the name of the output and the unit to be on separate line. The line return is also used to provide a taller box by being placed above and below the label for the box.

Let's get started now with creating our data.

```{r Displaying_First_Dataset}
x <- matrix(c(10,20,30,50),ncol=1, 
            dimnames=list(LETTERS[1:4],"x"))
y <- matrix(c(75,100,300,400),ncol=1,
            dimnames=list(LETTERS[1:4],"y"))

storenames<- c("Al\'s Pantry", "Bob\'s Mill", 
               "Trader Carrie\'s", "Dilbertson\'s")
temp<-cbind(storenames,x,y)
colnames(temp)<-c("Store Name", "Employees (x)", "Sales (y)")
```

The above commands create matrices that hold the data and have named rows and columns to match. The `<-` symbol is a key function in R and assigns what is on the right to the object on the left. We are creating the input and output data, named `x` and `y`. A temporary table, `temp` is then made for combining all the information in a single table. The apostrophe for store names needs to be prefixed with a slash to avoid it being misinterpreted when using it for a table. We can look at the the basic table by just giving the name of the table, `temp`.

```{r}
temp
```

We'll be using tables often throughout the book and it is worth putting some effort into making the table look better.

The next code chunk creates a better formatted table. We will use \index{kable} `kable` from the \index{knitr} `knitr` package for displaying the table. We will use the added package \index{kable!kableExtra} `kableExtra` to provide a simpler way to do sophisticated tables. We'll provide the code chunk for this table but generally avoid code chunks for displaying tables in the future unless there is a specific item to show.

Key items in this code chunk is that we ensure the \index{kable!kableExtra} `kableExtra` package is loaded. The \index{kable!kbl} `kbl` command is used to provide a shortcut for the \index{kable} `kable` function with explicit options available. Let's look at several of these options:

-   The \index{kable!booktabs} `booktabs` option is for generating clean PDF formatting of the tables required by the publisher.

-   The \index{kable!escape} `escape` option allows for LaTeX characters and code to be used as needed when set to `T` or `TRUE`.

-   The \index{Piping} piping operator `|>` means to pass the previous command's results into the next command. The piping operator requires R 4.1.0 or higher to be used.

-   The \index{kable!kable\_styling} `kable_styling` command provides a lot more formatting richness. In this case, it is passing an option of \index{kable!hold\_position} `HOLD_position` to ensure that LaTeX keeps the table placed close to this location.

For more information on using \index{kable} `kable` and \index{kable!kableExtra} `kableExtra` for doing mathematical modeling, see Appendix D of *Optimization Modeling Using R*.

```{r first-dataset-table}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library (kableExtra))
kbl (temp, booktabs=T, escape=F,
     caption="First Dataset for DEA") |>
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

For \index{Benchmarking} benchmarking, we want to know which ones are doing the best job.

Can you tell which stores represent the best trade-off between inputs and outputs? None of the stores are strictly dominated by any of the other stores. Dominance would be producing more outputs using less input so let's move on to looking at it graphically.

## Graphical Analysis

Let's start by doing a simple plot of the data. For now, I'm going to make use of a function in Peter Bogetoft and Lars Otto's \index{Benchmarking} `Benchmarking` package which provides a very handy two-dimensional plot in the format often used for showing production.

The first line loads the `Benchmarking` package and uses an optional parameter \index{quietly} `quietly` in order to not display comments that might be generated. The \index{dea.plot} `dea.plot` function takes the data with a variety of custom options, many of them specific to DEA types of plots:

-    \index{Returns to scale} \index{RTS|see{Returns to scale}} `RTS` represents returns to scale and will be dealt with in more detail later in this chapter as will orientation.

-   The `txt` parameter is used for passing data point labels. In this case, we check the length of the vector `x`, see that it has four letters, and then set `txt` to a list of the first four capital letters, A, B, C, and D. If we had used the `letters` function instead of `LETTERS` and 2:5, it would have given the letters b, c, d, and e.

-   Since the \index{dea.plot} `dea.plot` function is built upon standard R plot routines, the authors wisely allow for parameters to also be passed. For example, `fex` sets a scaling for the text data labels.

For more information on how to use the \index{Benchmarking} `Benchmarking` package along with a more economics-oriented treatment of DEA, please refer to the package's help file or [@BogetoftBenchmarkingDEASFA2011].

```{r  fig.cap="Plot of First Data Set"}
library(Benchmarking, quietly=TRUE)

dea.plot(x, y, RTS="crs", ORIENTATION="in-out", 
         txt=LETTERS[1:length(x)], 
         add=FALSE, wx=NULL, wy=NULL, TRANSPOSE=FALSE, 
         fex=1, GRID=TRUE, RANGE=FALSE, param=NULL)
```

This chart shows that unit *C* has the best ratio of output (y) to input (x). The diagonal line represents an \index{Efficiency frontier} efficiency frontier of best practices that could be achieved by scaling up or down unit *C*. As the input is scaled up or down, it is assumed that the output of unit *C* would be scaled up or down by the same proportion. We will revisit this assumption in a later section but for now, think of this as saying that unit *C* cannot enjoy economies of scale by getting larger or suffer from diseconomies of scale by getting smaller so it is referred to as constant returns to scale or CRS.

Furthermore, we can graphically examine the technical efficiency of each of the other units. I'm going to start with unit B since it is a little easier to visualize. For now, let's think of the question, how much more or less input would *C* require to produce as much output as *B*.

To determine this efficiency score, simply draw a horizontal line from *B* to the efficiency frontier on the left. This point can be thought of as a target for *B* to be efficient. This point has the same output as *B* but uses only half as much input. The efficiency score can be calculated as the ratio of the distance from the vertical axis to the target divided by the distance from the vertical axis to *B*. This distance is simply 10/20 or 50%.

Another result of the analysis is how to construct the target for *B*'s evaluation. The target is simply made by scaling down *C* to a third of its original size. This results in a target that is composed of about 0.333 of *C* and none of *A*, *B*, or *D*.

The same steps can be followed for analyzing units *A*, *C*, and *D* resulting in efficiency scores of 75%, 100%, and 80% respectively.

## A First Linear Program for DEA

The graphical approach is intuitive but accuracy is limited to that of drawing tools. More importantly, it does not scale to more complex models with multiple inputs and outputs. Let's frame this topic mathematically so that we can proceed systematically.

### Developing the Linear Program

\index{Linear program|(} \index{LP|see{Linear program}}
Let's begin to frame this more mathematically. From the graphical figure, we could say that we want to create a target for evaluating store B based on some multiple of store C. We want to create targets for B that produce at least as much output using the same input or less. For now, let's emphasize input-reduction. In this case, we modify this to say that we want to use as little input while producing the same output. Given that we have a single set input and single output case and we know that C is the standard setter for everyone, we can frame this mathematically.

Let's define this multiplier of unit C as $\lambda_C$. Given the emphasis on input-reduction, we can now require the target for B must produce the same level of output, as B actually did. This would be $y_C\cdot\lambda_C=y_B$ in terms of our data or $300\cdot\lambda_C=100$ or $\lambda_C=\frac{1}{3}$. The use of a Greek symbol, $\lambda$, is a common convention in the DEA field. It helps in avoiding confusion that *x* and *y* are commonly used as variables in optimization models but in DEA these are fixed data values.

Let's confirm this target based on $\lambda_C=\frac{1}{3}$ does in fact use less input than B does. The target uses $x_C\cdot\lambda_C=30\cdot\frac{1}{3}=10$. Since the target only requires *10* employees (input) as compared to the *20* used by B, we can say that the target for store B uses just 50% of the input used by the actual store B. We denote this efficiency, $\theta$ as the target input divided by the actual input.

$$\theta=\frac{x_C\cdot\lambda_C}{x_B}=\frac{30\cdot\frac{1}{3}}{20}=\frac{10}{20}=0.50$$

We could also rewrite that relationship for $\theta$ as $x_c\cdot\lambda_C=x_b\cdot\theta$. The best target for performance is based on C. If we did not know that we might try doing the same calculations using A, B, and D with $\lambda_A$, $\lambda_B$, and $\lambda_D$, respectively. The values of $\theta$ would be higher in each case.

In general, we don't usually know which unit is the standard setter as we did in this case for C, so let's work on generalizing this. Let's use all of the $\lambda$ variables at once. We'll also allow blended targets constructed out of parts of each of the four stores.

What we are really doing by finding the *best* target is finding the smallest value of $\theta$ that still produces the same level of output using as little input as possible.

On the output side we are saying:

$$y_A\cdot\lambda_A + y_B\cdot\lambda_B + y_C\cdot\lambda_C +y_D\cdot\lambda_D =  y_B$$

Substituting in numbers this would be

$$75\cdot\lambda_A + 100\cdot\lambda_B + 300\cdot\lambda_C +400\cdot\lambda_D =  100$$

The input relationship could be thought of as

$$x_A\cdot\lambda_A + x_B\cdot\lambda_B + x_C\cdot\lambda_C +x_D\cdot\lambda_D = \theta \cdot x_B$$

Our goal is to find the *best* target or smallest value of $\theta$. We could then pull this together to say

$$
\begin{split}
 \begin{aligned}
    \text{minimize  }   & \theta \\ 
  &  y_A\cdot\lambda_A + y_B\cdot\lambda_B + y_C\cdot\lambda_C +y_D\cdot\lambda_D =  y_B\\
 & x_A\cdot\lambda_A + x_B\cdot\lambda_B + x_C\cdot\lambda_C +x_D\cdot\lambda_D = \theta \cdot x_B
\end{aligned}
  \end{split}
$$

This is a linear program which we could then enter and run. If we do so, we would find that some of the values of $\lambda$ would be negative. Using negative values of a store to make a target for performance doesn't really make sense. A zero value makes sense but not a negative value so we add non-negativity \index{Constraints|(} constraints or bounds on the $\lambda$ values.

$$
\begin{split}
 \begin{aligned}
    \text{minimize  }   & \theta \\ 
  \text{subject to:  }   &  y_A\cdot\lambda_A + y_B\cdot\lambda_B + y_C\cdot\lambda_C +y_D\cdot\lambda_D =  y_B\\
 & x_A\cdot\lambda_A + x_B\cdot\lambda_B + x_C\cdot\lambda_C +x_D\cdot\lambda_D = \theta \cdot x_B \\
 & x_A, \; x_B, \; x_C, \; x_D \geq 0 
\end{aligned}
  \end{split}
$$

Next, since we are trying to find the smallest possible value of $\theta$, we could in fact relax the equality constraints to be inequalities. For the output, the target for B must be at least as large as the actual output of B. For the input constraint we could say that the target input for B cannot exceed the reduced input used by B. For brevity, we can also abbreviate *minimize* as *min* and *subject to* as *s.t.*. This gives us the following linear program formulation.

$$
\begin{split}
 \begin{aligned}
    \text{min  }   & \theta \\ 
  \text{s.t.:  }   &  y_A\cdot\lambda_A + y_B\cdot\lambda_B + y_C\cdot\lambda_C +y_D\cdot\lambda_D \geq  y_B\\
 & x_A\cdot\lambda_A + x_B\cdot\lambda_B + x_C\cdot\lambda_C +x_D\cdot\lambda_D \leq \theta \cdot x_B \\
 & x_A, \; x_B, \; x_C, \; x_D \geq 0 
\end{aligned}
  \end{split}
$$

### Implementing a First Linear Program for DEA

\index{ompr|(}

Let's make a simple, explicit linear program for doing DEA. We are going to use the `ompr` package.

For this case, let's use the numbers directly for values of inputs and outputs to examine the efficiency of store B.

$$
 \begin{split}
 \begin{aligned}
    \text{Min    } & \theta &\text{[Efficiency]}\\
    \text{s.t.:  } & 75 \lambda_A + 100 \lambda_B +
                    300 \lambda_C + 400 \lambda_D 
                    \geq 100 &\text{[Output]}\\
                    & 10 \lambda_A + 20 \lambda_B +
                    30 \lambda_C + 50 \lambda_D 
                    \leq 20 \theta &\text{[Input]}\\
                  & \lambda_A , \; \lambda_B , \; \lambda_D , \; \lambda_D \geq 0  
                  & \text{[Non-negativity]}
  \end{aligned}
  \end{split}
$$

We're going to use our data from earlier.

The first step is to load a collection of libraries to be used later. The `ompr` package is for optimization and serves as a general human readable format of optimization models that can then interface with a variety of solver engines. The \index{ROI.plugin.glpk} `ROI.plugin.glpk` package is for the specific solver engine, \index{glpk} `glpk`, that we used. Other LP solving engines are available and can be used instead.

```{r loading_packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ROI, quietly=TRUE)             
library(ROI.plugin.glpk, quietly=TRUE) 
library(ompr, quietly=TRUE)            
library(ompr.roi, quietly=TRUE)        
```

The `ROI` package is the R Optimization Interface and provides a standardized interface layer to different optimization routines. The specific routines are provided through a plugin, in this case, \index{ROI.plugin.glpk} `ROI.plugin.glpk` for the glpk optimization system. A variety of other optimization systems can be used as well by using the corresponding plugin. The `ompr` package provides the \index{Algebraic modeling} algebraic modeling functions for building the model to then pass to `ROI` by way of the \index{ompr.roi} `ompr.roi` package. While this layered structure may sound complicated, it has several important benefits. First, it allows for concise algebraic representation of the linear program by way of `ompr`. Second, the use of the `ROI` layer allows the analyst to change the optimization system used (such as from `glpk` to \index{symphony} `symphony`) without affecting the model built.

```{r}
mod2_0 <- MIPModel ()
```

The \index{ompr!MIPModel} `MIPModel` command creates an initial, empty model which we name `mod2_0` to represent our initial optimization model in chapter two.

The following commands \index{ompr!add\_variable} create and add each of the four $\lambda$ variables one at a time to the `mod2_0` model and resaves it as the same model. We can't use the Greek symbol, $\lambda$ directly in the `ompr` model so we will use a capital `L` instead. Each of these $\lambda$ variables are defined to be continuous variables and have lower bounds of 0 by using `lb=0`. We use a prefix of `V` to indicate that this is a mathematical programming variable and differentiate it from any R object in our environment with the same name. The `V` prefix convention is purely optional but I found using it decreases accidental problems of name conflicts.

The $\theta$ variable is added in the same manner but does not need a lower bound 0 of zero.

```{r}
mod2_0 <- add_variable(mod2_0, VL_A, type="continuous", lb=0)
mod2_0 <- add_variable(mod2_0, VL_B, type="continuous", lb=0)
mod2_0 <- add_variable(mod2_0, VL_C, type="continuous", lb=0)
mod2_0 <- add_variable(mod2_0, VL_D, type="continuous", lb=0)

mod2_0 <- add_variable(mod2_0, Vtheta, type="continuous")
```

We can get a summary of our status of building up the `mod2_0` linear program model by just entering `mod2_0` object.

```{r}
mod2_0
```

We can see that we have five variables. Next, let's add our \index{Objective function} objective function (*min* $\theta$).

```{r}
mod2_0 <- set_objective(mod2_0, Vtheta, "min")
```
 
Next we can add our output \index{ompr!add\_constraint} \index{Constraints!Output} constraint.

```{r}
mod2_0 <- add_constraint (mod2_0, 75*VL_A+100*VL_B+300*VL_C+400*VL_D >= 100)
```

Our last `ompr` model building command is to add our input \index{Constraints!Input} constraint.

```{r}
mod2_0 <- add_constraint (mod2_0, 10*VL_A+20*VL_B+30*VL_C+50*VL_D <= 20*Vtheta)
```

We can now solve the linear programming model and place the results in `res2_0`. We are going to use the \index{glpk} `glpk` linear programming solver.

```{r}
res2_0 <- solve_model(mod2_0, with_ROI (solver="glpk"))
```

Let's check the status to ensure that it found an optimal solution. The result object contains seven elements.

-   `res2_0$model`: This gives a summary of the model including the number and types of variables, the number of constraints and whether the objective function is to minimize or maximize. It can be helpful to check this to ensure that the model is the size of what is intended. Further details of the model can be examined such as the objective function by entering `res2_0$model$objective`.

\index{Constraints|)}

-   `res2_0$objective_value`: Gives the objective function value, in this case the the optimal value of $\theta$.

-   `res2_0$status`: This gives a clear statement as to whether the model was solved to optimality (success) or any other condition (error). This status is helpful because while most solvers return a numerical error code to describe the result of the optimization, the actual interpretation of the error code for each solver can be very different. The term error here encompasses a number of other conditions such as infeasibility, unbounded optimal solution, or an early termination condition being met due for reasons such as a suboptimality tolerance factor being met or a a time limit. If the status returns an error, the analyst should the more detailed information from the solver described below.

-   `res2_0$solution`: A nicely formatted set of decision variable values.

-   `res2_0$solution_column_duals`: \index{Dual values!Column} Dual values of the decision variables (columns).

-   `res2_0$solution_row_duals`: \index{Dual values!Row} Dual values of the constraints (rows). In the DEA envelopment model, these can be used to find the solution to the DEA multiplier model.

-   `res2_0$additional_solver_output`: This collects detailed information directly from the solver used and is particularly helpful for diagnosing problems when the \index{Solver status} solver status is "error" or in integer programming optimization problems that are solving slowly.

Let's start with checking the status.

```{r}
res2_0$status
```

Since it was successful, let's move on to examining the results.

```{r}
res2_0$solution
```

Notice that it provided the variables using the same names as we had in the implementation, including our `V` prefix. Let's provide the results in a nicely formatted table with column names corresponding to the mathematical model.

\index{ompr|)}

```{r}
kbl (t(as.matrix(res2_0$solution)), 
     digits =3, booktabs=T, escape=F,
     col.names=c("$\\lambda_A$", "$\\lambda_B$", "$\\lambda_C$", 
                 "$\\lambda_D$", "$\\theta$"),
     caption="Initial Input-Oriented Envelopment Analysis for DMU B") |>
  add_header_above(c("Envelopment Variables" = 4, 
                     "Efficiency" = 1))|>
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

There is a lot going on in this command. Let's unpack it step by step.

-   The first line takes the solution object, converts it to a matrix, and then transposes it from a \index{Orientation} row orientation to a column orientation.

-   The second line sets the number of \index{kable!digits} `digits` to 3, \index{kable!booktabs} `booktabs` is set again for high quality publication, and \index{kable!escape} `escape` is set to `FALSE` or `F` in order to enable LaTeX for column names.

-   The third and fourth lines of code provide LaTeX symbols for column names.

-   The fifth line sets a \index{kable!caption} caption and then \index{Piping} pipes (or passes) the \index{kable} `kable` object to the next command using `|>` \index{Piping} piping operator.

-   The last statement, since it is connected by a pipe, takes the previous table and gives it a latex option of `HOLD_position` that tells our LaTeX rendering system to try to place the table at the particular spot rather than allowing it to float and be placed in a position that favors nice typesetting.

In general, we'll usually omit the details of this type of table formatting in most of the rest of the book to save on space.

## A More Formal and General Linear Program

A key way to begin the mathematical development of the envelopment model is to ask, can you find a combination of units that produces a target with at least as much output using less input? The blend of other units is described by a vector $\lambda$. Another way to denote this is that $\lambda_j$ is the specific amount of a unit *j* used in setting the target for performance for unit *k*.

This can be easily expanded to the multiple input and multiple output case by defining $x_{i,j}$ to be the amount of the *i*'th input used by unit *j* and $y_{r,j}$ to be the amount of the *r*'th output produced by unit *j*.

For simplicity, this example will focus on the one input and one output case rather than the *m* input and *s* output case but the R code explicitly allows for $m,s>1$. To make the code more readable, I will use a slightly different convention $N^X$ or `NX` instead of *m* to refer to the number of inputs (*x*'s) and $N^Y$ or `NY` to be the number of outputs (*y*'s) instead of *s*. Also, the normal mathematical convention is to use *n* to denote the number of \index{Decision making unit} \index{DMU|see{Decision making unit}} Decision Making Units (DMUs) so I will use $N^D$ or `ND` to indicate that in the R code.

Let's connect these ideas together now using these mathematical building blocks. The core idea of the envelopment model of a DMU *k* can be thought of as to find a target constructed of a mix of the DMUs described by a vector $\lambda$ that uses no more input to achieve the same or more of every output as DMU *k*. The amount of the *i'th* input used by the target is then $\sum_{j=1}^{N^D} x_{i,j}\lambda_j$. By the same token, the amount of the *r'th* output produced by the target is $\sum_{j=1}^{N^D} y_{r,j}\lambda_j$.

This gives us two sets of constraints along with a restriction of non-negativity. These are shown in the following relationships that must all be satisfied simultaneously.

$$
\begin{split}
 \begin{aligned}
    \ & \sum_{j=1}^{N^D} x_{i,j}\lambda_j \leq x_{i,k} \; \forall \; i\\
                       & \sum_{j=1}^{N^D} y_{r,j}\lambda_j \geq  y_{r,k} \;  \forall \; r\\
                       & \lambda_j \geq 0  \; \forall \; j
    \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:Ch2ConstructingTargets)
  \end{split}
$$

The symbol $\forall$ should be read as "for all". This means that the first input \index{Constraints!Input} constraint with $\forall \; i$ is repeated for all values of *i*. In this case, it would mean that we repeat this constraint for values of *i* from *1* to $N^X$. In our single-input case ( $N^X=1$ ), we would only have one input constraint. Similarly, $\forall \; r$ indicates that we are repeating this constraint for each possible value of *r* from *1* to $N^Y$. Lastly, we will often use $\forall$ *j* to indicate for all \index{Decision making unit} decision making units from 1 to $N^D$. For the sake of brevity in our linear programming formulations, we will use the $\forall$ *i*, *r*, or *j* when it is for all the possible inputs, or outputs, or decision making units respectively.

This is not yet a linear program because it is missing an objective function. It defines what is an acceptable target of performance that is at least as good as DMU *k* but does not try to find a *best* target.

The two most common approaches to finding the best target are the input-oriented and output-oriented models. In the output-oriented model, the first (input) \index{Constraints!Input} constraint is satisfied while trying to *exceed* the second \index{Constraints!Output} constraint (output) by as much possible. This focus on increasing the output is then called an *output-orientation*.

In this chapter, we will focus on satisfying the second constraint while trying to improve upon the first by as much as possible. In other words, we will satisfy the second (output) \index{Constraints!Output} constraint but try to form a target that uses as little input as possible.

Let's define the proportion of the studied unit's input needed by the target as $\theta$. A value of $\theta=1$ then means no input reduction can be found in order to produce that unit's level of output. Similarly, $x_j$ is the amount of input used by unit *j* and $y_j$ is the amount of output produced by unit *j*.

In fact, we will go one step further and say that we want to find the maximum input possible reduction in *k*'s input or conversely, the minimum amount of the input that could be used by the target while still producing the same or more output. We do this by adding a new variable, $\theta$, which is the radial reduction in the amount of DMU *k*'s input. We want to find how low we can drive this by *minimizing* $\theta$. This gives us the following linear program, often abbreviated as LP.[^02-io_env-1]

[^02-io_env-1]: The mathematics in this book are written using LaTeX embedded within the Rmarkdown document. Another benefit of using Rmarkdown is that it is possible embed LaTeX without requiring using a full LaTeX document.

$$
 \begin{split}
 \begin{aligned}
    \text{min    } & \theta \\
    \text{s.t.:  } & \sum_{j=1}^{N^D} x_{i,j}\lambda_j \leq \theta x_{i,k} \; \forall \; i\\
                   & \sum_{j=1}^{N^D} y_{r,j}\lambda_j \geq  y_{r,k} \; \forall \; r\\
                   & \lambda_j \geq 0  \; \forall \; j
  \end{aligned}
  \end{split}
$$

Expressing the target on the left and the actual unit's value with the radial reduction on the right is conceptually straightforward to understand. Standard form is to collect all the terms with variables on the left and putting constants (terms without variables) on the right hand side of the inequalities. This is easily done.

$$
\begin{split}
\begin{aligned}
    \text{min  }   & \theta \\
    \text{s.t.:  } & \sum_{j=1}^{N^D} x_{i,j}\lambda_j - \theta x_{i,k} \leq 0 \; \forall \; i\\
                   & \sum_{j=1}^{N^D} y_{r,j}\lambda_j \geq  y_{r,k} \;  \forall \; r\\
                   & \lambda_j \geq 0  \; \forall \; j
  \end{aligned}
 \end{split}
$$

### Implementing the LP Algebraically

There are two fundamentally different approaches to setting up linear programs for solving. The first approach is to define data structures to pass vectors for the objective function coefficients and constraint right hand sides along with a matrix of data describing the \index{Constraints} constraints. This requires careful setting up of the linear programs and is a bigger cognitive step away from the mathematical representation. Another approach is to use \index{Algebraic modeling} algebraic modeling languages. Standalone algebraic optimization modeling languages include LINGO, AMPL, GAMS, GMPL, and others.

Until recently, R did not have the ability to do algebraic modeling optimization but recently a few efforts have provided support for this. The \index{ompr} `ompr` package provides an algebraic perspective that closely matches the summation representation of a linear program shown earlier. If you want to see the data structure format approach, that is covered in the next chapter.

Let's define some data structures for holding our data and results.

```{r Declaring_Structures_of_Results_ompr}
ND <- nrow(x); NX <- ncol(x); NY <- ncol(y); # Define data size

xdata<-x[1:ND,] 
dim(xdata)<-c(ND,NX) 
ydata<-y[1:ND,]
dim(ydata)<-c(ND,NY)

       # Now we will create lists of names
DMUnames <- list(c(LETTERS[1:ND]))               
       # DMU names: A, B, ...
Xnames <- lapply(list(rep("X",NX)),paste0,1:NX)   
       # Input names: X1, ...
Ynames <- lapply(list(rep("Y",NY)),paste0,1:NY)   
       # Output names: Y1, ...
Lambdanames <- lapply(list(rep("L_",ND)),paste0, 
                      LETTERS[1:ND])

results.efficiency <- matrix(rep(-1.0, ND), nrow=ND)
dimnames(results.efficiency)<-c(DMUnames,"CCR-IO")  
  
results.lambda     <- matrix(rep(-1.0, ND^2), nrow=ND)
dimnames(results.lambda)<-c(DMUnames,Lambdanames)

```

We are going to start by building a model for just one DMU, in this case, the second DMU (B) by setting `k`to be 2.

```{r}
k<-2    # DMU to analyze, for this case DMU, B.
```

Let's demonstrate this one step at a time.

```{r}
mod2_1 <- MIPModel() 
```

We start by using the `ompr` model initialization command, \index{ompr!MIPModel} `MIPModel` and creating an empty model named `mod2_1`, to represent the first model of chapter 2.

```{r}
mod2_1 <- add_variable(mod2_1,
             Vlambda[j], j = 1:ND, type = "continuous", lb = 0) 
```

Let's start with our $\lambda$ \index{ompr!add\_variable} variables. In this statement, we add variables named `Vlambda` to the model, `mod2_1` and assign the more complete object back to the same object, `mod2_1`. We set `Vlambda` to have separate variables, indexed from `1` to `ND`, each of which are of a continuous type and have a lower bound (`lb`) of zero. Since we have 4 units that can have elements mixed, `ND=4`, and therefore we have four non-negative continuous variables. Note that I follow a convention of prefixing all linear programming variables with a `V` to differentiate from a variable inside of an `ompr` model and other R objects in my working environment. Conflicts between `R` and `ompr` variables seem to arise often among `ompr` users.

Next, let's add the $\theta$ variable.

```{r}
mod2_1 <- add_variable(mod2_1, Vtheta, type = "continuous") 
```

This follows the same format but there is only one variable. Also, it does not need to have a lower bound.

Moving on to the \index{ompr!set\_objective} objective function, we set the objective function for the linear program using the `set_objective`function. In this case, our objective function was *minimize* $\theta$ .

```{r}
mod2_1 <- set_objective(mod2_1, Vtheta, "min")
```

Next, we will move on to the \index{ompr!add\_constraint} constraints. We'll start with the \index{Constraints!Input} constraints on the inputs, limiting the amount of inputs used by a unit to no more of the input than the unit being studied. Recall the constraint, $\sum_{j=1}^{N^D}x_{i,j}\lambda_j\leq\theta x_{i,k}\;\forall\;i$ but in our case, there is only one input so *i* is *1*.

```{r}
mod2_1 <- add_constraint(mod2_1,
                         sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * xdata[j,1], j = 1:ND) 
                         <= Vtheta * xdata[k,1])
```

Now we do the same thing with our output \index{Constraints!Output} constraint.

```{r}
mod2_1 <- add_constraint(mod2_1, 
                         sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * ydata[j,1], 
                                  j = 1:ND) 
                         >= ydata[k,1])
```

At this point, we now have a complete model. Simply typing the `mod2_1`in the console after running all of the above commands will result in a summary of the model.

```{r}
mod2_1
```

This model is the size we expect. Let's go ahead and \index{ompr!solve\_model} solve it now.

```{r}
res2_1 <- solve_model(mod2_1, with_ROI(solver = "glpk"))
```

This command solves the passed model, `mod2_1` by using the R Optimization Interface to use the \index{glpk} GLPK solver. The result is then assigned to `res2_1`.

Again, we can get a summary of this \index{ompr!Results object} results object by simply typing in the object name, `res2_1`.

```{r}
res2_1
```

This tells us that the model was successfully solved to optimality and that the optimal solution ($\theta$ in our case), was 0.50.

Building the model up step by step can be helpful but a more concise form of model building connects each command to the previous one using a \index{Piping} piping operator, `|>`. One way to think of piping is that if you have two functions, A and B and want to use the result of function A in B, you can do this `A() |> B()` or "Take A's result and pass it into the start of B." The piping is the same operator that we use to pass a \index{kable} `kable` table into `kable_styling`.

```{r first_ompr_piped_model}
mod2_1 <- MIPModel()                                          |>
  add_variable(Vlambda[j], j = 1:ND, type = "continuous", 
               lb = 0)                                        |>
  add_variable(Vtheta, type = "continuous")                   |>
  set_objective(Vtheta, "min")                                |>
  add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * xdata[j,1], j = 1:ND) 
                 <= Vtheta * xdata[k,1])                      |>
  add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * ydata[j,1], j = 1:ND) 
                 >= ydata[k,1])

res2_1 <- solve_model(mod2_1, with_ROI(solver = "glpk")) 
```

The piping command command was used in making a nicely formatted table but it can also make model building much more concise to not need to keep reassigning things to the model with each command. A few things to keep in mind with piping:

-   Piping was first implemented in R by way of packages such as `magrittr` and became so popular that a piping operator, `|>`, was added to the base system of `R` in version 4.1.0 (mid 2021). This means that you will get an error message if you try to use `|>` operator on earlier versions of R. You can upgrade the version of R, unpipe the commands, or use `magrittr` and the older `%>%` pipe operator.
-   The pipe command is like glue connecting two commands together. This highlights that you don't want to end with another pipe that expects a different object. The last `add_constraint` command does **not** have a pipe.
-   The solving is based on passing in the model, `mod2_1` directly but could have also been piped.
-   Piped models are shorter making them easier to write and express.
-   Piped models may be harder to \index{Piping!debugging} debug as syntax errors may point to the full piped object rather than just one individual line. Using the piping metaphor, this is equivalent to being told that there is a leak *somewhere* in the home's plumbing as compared to being told which particular pipe connection is leaking. This is potentially a very important reason for many people to build unpiped models, at least for development purposes.
-   Piped `ompr` models may be more concise looking but do not appear to run faster based on my early tests.

Now, let's get to looking over the results.

```{r}
res2_1theta <- get_solution(res2_1, Vtheta) 
res2_1lambda <- get_solution(res2_1, Vlambda[j])
```

Again, we can view both results.

```{r}
res2_1theta  
res2_1lambda 
```

These results match what we expect but let's clean up the formatting. For example, the $\lambda$ values returned provide a lot of excess information. The following commands do some cleaning up of the results.

```{r, results = 'asis'}
   # Only doing analysis for one unit at a time to start

res2_1.efficiency <- matrix(rep(-1.0, 1), nrow=1, ncol=1)
res2_1.lambda     <- matrix(rep(-1.0, ND), nrow=1, ncol=ND)
res2_1.efficiency <- t(res2_1theta)
res2_1.lambda <- t(res2_1lambda[3])
      # Takes the third column from the results and transposes
      #    results to be structured correctly for later viewing
```

The following code chunk demonstrates the model building.

It starts by generating a set of names based on model dimensions using the \index{TRA!DEAnames} `DEAnames` function from the `TRA` package. The syntax needed for giving names such $\lambda_C$ can be tricky and a lot of typing. The TRA package provides a set of common DEA names for a variety of model sizes.

We will then select to use the \index{TRA!LambdanamesbyletterLX} `LambdanamesbyletterLX` to give LaTeX structured column names ready to be used as column names. We can can then apply column names to the table without needing to redefine the original table. We will often use a similar approach but will not display the table generating code chunk for brevity.

```{r}
res2_1.names <- TRA::DEAnames(NX, NY, ND)

kbl(cbind(res2_1.efficiency, res2_1.lambda), 
    booktabs=T, digits=3, escape=F, 
    col.names=c("$\\theta^{CRS}$", res2_1.names$LambdanamesbyletterLX),
    caption= 'Input-Oriented Envelopment Analysis for DMU B') |>
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

The above table follows a few convenient \index{Conventions} conventions. Rather than just using \$\\theta\$, we label the efficiency score by the returns to scale used for the model, in this case the constant returns to scale is used and therefore $\theta$ is superscripted with CRS. In some research, it might be labeled as CCR after Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes [@CharnesDataEnvelopmentAnalysis1978]. Later we will cover other models including the variable returns to scale model and label it is as VRS although it is often labeled BCC after Banker, Charnes, and Cooper [@Bankermodelsestimatingtechnical1984].

The results in the table indicate that DMU *B* has an efficiency score of 50%. The target of performance is made of DMU *C* scaled down by a factor of 0.33. These results match the graphical results from earlier.

Let's now extend it to handle multiple inputs, `NX`, and outputs, `NY`. Of course this doesn't have any impact on our results just yet since we are still only using a single input and output but we now have the structure to accommodate the more general case. To provide a little variety, we'll change it to the first DMU, A, (`k<-1`) to give a little more variety.

The key change to accommodate multiple inputs is to change the `add_constraint` command to repeat this constraint for `i = 1:NX`. This means that the constraint is repeated for every value from 1 to `NX`. If we had 10 inputs ($N^X=10$) then there would be ten constraints. The first substituting in `i=1`, the second `i=2`, etc.

```{r ompr-mult-IO, message=FALSE, results='asis'}
k<-1    # DMU to analyze.  Let's change it to the first unit, DMU A.

res2_2 <- MIPModel()                                              |>
  add_variable(Vlambda[j], j = 1:ND, type = "continuous", lb = 0) |>
  add_variable(Vtheta, type = "continuous")                       |>
  set_objective(Vtheta, "min")                                    |>
  add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * xdata[j,i], j = 1:ND) 
                 <= Vtheta * xdata[k,i], i = 1:NX)                |>
  add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * ydata[j,r], j = 1:ND) 
                 >= ydata[k,r], r = 1:NY)                         |>
  solve_model(with_ROI(solver = "glpk")) 

res2_2theta <-  get_solution(res2_2, Vtheta) 
res2_2lambda <-  get_solution(res2_2, Vlambda[j])

res2_2.efficiency <- t(res2_2theta)
res2_2.lambda <- t(res2_2lambda[3])
 # Takes the third column from the results and transposes 
  #    results to be structured better for later viewing
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# No need to recreate names structure because they are the same as earlier.
# res2_2.names <- TRA::DEAnames(NX, NY, ND)

kbl(cbind(res2_2.efficiency, res2_2.lambda), 
    booktabs=T, digits=3, escape=F, 
    col.names=c("$\\theta^{CRS}$", res2_1.names$LambdanamesbyletterLX),
    caption= 'Input-Oriented Envelopment Analysis for DMU A') |>
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Efficiency" = 1, "Envelopment Variables" = 4)) |>
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

Again, the results match what would be expected from Figure 1. Now we will extend this to handle all four of the decision making units by using a `for` loop.

```{r ompr_mult_DMUs, message=FALSE}
res2_3.efficiency <- matrix(rep(-1.0, 1), nrow=ND, ncol=1)
res2_3.lambda     <- matrix(rep(-1.0, ND), nrow=ND,ncol=ND)

for (k in 1:ND) {

  res2_3 <- MIPModel()                                              |>
    add_variable(Vlambda[j], j = 1:ND, type = "continuous", lb = 0) |>
    add_variable(Vtheta, type = "continuous")                       |>
    set_objective(Vtheta, "min")                                    |>
    add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * xdata[j,i], j = 1:ND) 
                   <= Vtheta * xdata[k,i], i = 1:NX)                |>
    add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * ydata[j,r], j = 1:ND) 
                   >= ydata[k,r], r = 1:NY)                         |>
    solve_model(with_ROI(solver = "glpk")) 
  
  print(c("DMU=",k,solver_status(res2_3)))
  res2_3.efficiency[k] <-  get_solution(res2_3, Vtheta)       
  res2_3.lambda[k,] <- t(as.matrix(as.numeric(
    get_solution(res2_3, Vlambda[j])[,3] )))
# Put result from solution in lambda matrix
# Comes out of ompr as a dataframe, use as.matrix to convert from 
#    data frame to matrix
# Grabs 3rd column to put into results matrix.  
# First two columns of dataframe are for other info as.numeric 
#    forces the numbers to treated as numbers rather than text.
}
```

Success! This indicates each of the four linear programs was solved to optimality. By itself, it doesn't help much though. We need to now display each column of results.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
temp <- cbind(res2_1.names$DMUnamesbyletter, # Add letters as column
              res2_3.efficiency,
              format (res2_3.lambda, digits=3, drop0trailing = TRUE)) 
kbl(temp, booktabs=T, digits=3, escape=F, row.names=F,
    col.names=c("DMU", "$\\theta^{CRS}$", res2_1.names$LambdanamesbyletterLX),
    caption= 'Input-Oriented Envelopment Efficiency Results') |>
  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Efficiency" = 1, "Envelopment Variables" = 4))  |>
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

This table command uses a few extra practices of building the table into a temporary object, `temp` and adding a column of DMU names to it rather than using row names. Again, names have not changed from the `res2_1` so there is no need to recreate the names. We then turn off the display of row names in the table using `row.names=F`.

The results match those observed graphically but let's discuss them. These results indicate that only DMU *C* is efficient. A rescaled version of *C* could produce the same level of output of *A*, *B*, and *D*, while using 25%, 50%, and 20% less input respectively. The targets of performance for *A* and *C* are constructed by scaling down unit *C* to a much smaller size, as shown by the the values of $\lambda$. In contrast, *D*'s performance is surpassed by a 33% larger version of *C*.

It is an important step of any DEA study to carefully examine the results. In this case, it might be argued that for certain applications, *C*'s business practices do not scale linearly and therefore could not be assumed to operate at a much smaller or larger size. In that case, we should consider modeling returns to scale.

\index{Linear program|)}

## Returns to Scale

### Variable Returns to Scale

\index{Variable returns to scale|(} \index{VRS|see{Variable returns to scale}}

Up to this point, our analyses used an assumption of constant returns to scale. This might result in targets that are considered unfair as it can build a target based on a radically larger or smaller set of DMUs. Whether the stores were larger or smaller, store C set the performance target for other units.

Instead, let's add a constraint that says that the target of performance must be made up of parts that add up to a whole unit. All it needs to do is constrain the sum of the $\lambda$ variables to equal 1 or in other words, $\sum_{j} \lambda_j = 1$. This prevents the target from being made up of just one greatly shrunken version of a unit, say C making the target for A in our earlier example. It also prevents an over reliance of scaling up a unit to make the performance target, in our example C being scaled up to make a comparison target for D. This constraint makes the model into a variables returns to scale or VRS input-oriented envelopment model.

\index{Variable returns to scale|)}

$$
\begin{split}
\begin{aligned}
    \text{minimize  }   & \theta \\
    \text{subject to } & \sum_{j=1}^{n} x_{i,j}\lambda_j \leq \theta x_{i,k} \; \forall \; i\\
                       & \sum_{j=1}^{n} y_{r,j}\lambda_j \geq y_{r,k} \; \forall \; r\\
                       & \sum_{j=1}^{n} \lambda_j  = 1\\
                       & \lambda_j \geq 0  \; \forall  \; j
  \end{aligned}
  (\#eq:Ch2LPBCCIOE) 
 \end{split}
$$

To incorporate this, we can add another constraint to our previous model and solve it. Let's define a parameter, `RTS,` to describe which returns to scale assumption we are using and only add the VRS constraint when `RTS` is set to `"VRS"`.[^02-io_env-2]

[^02-io_env-2]: In R, as in many languages, the distinction between assignment and testing for equivalency is important. Two symbols are used for assignment, `=` or `<-` while `==` is used to test for whether two items are equivalent.

for (k in 1:ND) {

                 lb = 0)                                            |>

  if (RTS=="VRS") 
    {mod2_4 <- add_constraint(mod2_4, 
                              sum_expr(Vlambda[j], j = 1:ND) == 1) 
    }  #Returns to Scale

    res2_4.efficiency[k] <-  get_solution(res2_4, Vtheta)       
    res2_4.lambda[k,] <- t(as.matrix(as.numeric(
              get_solution(res2_4, Vlambda[j])[,3] )))
}  # Repeat for each unit, k
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
temp <- cbind(res2_1.names$DMUnamesbyletter, # Add letters as column
              
              format (cbind(res2_4.efficiency, res2_4.lambda), 
                      digits=4, drop0trailing = TRUE)) 
kbl(temp, 
    booktabs=T,  escape=F, row.names=F,

  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Efficiency" = 1, "Envelopment Variables" = 4))  |>
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

Notice that the efficiencies have increased or stayed the same. Whereas earlier three out of four DMUs were inefficient, now three out of four are efficient. One way of thinking of returns to scale is whether doubling the inputs should be expected to result in doubling the outputs that should be achieved. Another way to think of it is whether it is fair to think of scaling up or down an efficient significantly to set a performance target for a much bigger or smaller unit. For example, would it be *fair* to compare a small convenience store such as 7-11 to a CostCo store scaled down by a factor of a 100?

### Other Returns to Scale

In addition to Constant Returns to Scale (CRS) and Variable Returns to Scale (VRS), two other common approaches are  \index{Increasing returns to scale} \index{IRS|see{Increasing returns to scale}} Increasing Returns to Scale (IRS) and \index{Decreasing returns to scale} \index{DRS|see{Decreasing returns to scale}} Decreasing Returns to Scale (DRS). Technically, IRS is sometimes more formally referred to as non-decreasing returns to scale. Similarly, DRS corresponds to non-increasing returns to scale.

The actual returns to scale models are straightforward to implement.

| Returns to Scale | Envelopment Constraint              |
|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| CRS              | No constraint needed                |
| VRS              | $\sum_{j=1}^{N^D} \lambda_j = 1$    |
| IRS/NDRS         | $\sum_{j=1}^{N^D} \lambda_j \geq 1$ |
| DRS/NIRS         | $\sum_{j=1}^{N^D} \lambda_j \leq 1$ |

No envelopment constraint on the sum of $\lambda$ is needed to create a CRS model and to convert a VRS formulation into a CRS we can just delete the new constraint. On the other hand, it may sometimes be helpful to maintain a consistent model size in terms of number of constraints as we make richer models. We can make it a redundant \index{Constraints!Redundant} constraint by constraining the sum of $\lambda$ to be greater than or equal to zero, $\sum_{j} \lambda_j\geq0$. Since $\lambda$'s are by definition non-negative, the sum of $\lambda$'s is also non-negative and therefore the constraint is superfluous or redundant.

Now, we will generalize this by allowing a parameter to set the returns to scale.

```{r Adding-RTS}
res2_5.efficiency <- matrix(rep(-1.0, 1), nrow=ND, ncol=1)

                 lb = 0)                                              |>

                   >= ydata[k,r], r = 1:NY)

    if (RTS=="VRS") {mod2_5 <-
      add_constraint(mod2_5, sum_expr(Vlambda[j], 
                                      j = 1:ND) == 1) }  
    if (RTS=="IRS") {mod2_5 <-
      add_constraint(mod2_5, sum_expr(Vlambda[j], 
                                      j = 1:ND) >= 1) }  
    if (RTS=="DRS") {mod2_5 <-
      add_constraint(mod2_5, sum_expr(Vlambda[j], 
                                      j = 1:ND) <= 1) }  

  res2_5 <-   solve_model(mod2_5, with_ROI(solver = "glpk"))

              get_solution(res2_5, Vlambda[j])[,3] )))
} #Close loop for each DMU

## Multiple Inputs and Multiple Outputs

Using DEA for two-dimensional examples such as the one-input, one-output model is easy to draw and visualize but overkill and not generally very useful.

```{r}
x <- matrix(c(10, 20, 30, 50, 22, 29,
              75, 100, 220, 480, 290, 210), byrow=FALSE, ncol=2, 
            dimnames=list(LETTERS[1:6],c("x1","x2")))
y <- matrix(c(75,100,300,400, 280, 120),ncol=1,
            dimnames=list(LETTERS[1:6],"y"))

storenames<- c("Al\'s Pantry", "Bob\'s Mill", 
               "Trader Carrie\'s", "Dilbertson\'s",
               "Ed\'s Eggshop", "Flo\'s Farmacopia")
temp<-cbind(storenames,x,y)
colnames(temp)<-c("Store Name", "Employees (x1)", "Floor Space (x2)", 
                  "Sales (y)")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kbl(temp, 
    booktabs=T, escape=F, row.names=T,
    caption= "Two Input, Single Output Grocery Store Example") |>
    add_header_above(c(" " = 2, "Inputs" = 2, 
                     "Ouptut" = 1))                            |>
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

Let's extend our earlier store management by adding as an input, store floor space and two more stores,

Note that I'm naming the data sets based on their origin and then loading them into `xdata` and `ydata` for actual operation. This allows the model to be generalized.

```{r Prepare-data}
ND <- nrow(x); NX <- ncol(x); NY <- ncol(y)

xdata      <-x[1:ND,]  # Call it xdata
dim(xdata) <-c(ND,NX)  # structure data correctly
ydata      <-y[1:ND,]
dim(ydata) <-c(ND,NY)

# Need to remember to restructure the results matrices.

results.efficiency <- matrix(rep(-1.0, ND), nrow=ND, ncol=1)
results.lambda     <- matrix(rep(-1.0, ND^2), nrow=ND,ncol=ND)
results.vweight    <- matrix(rep(-1.0, ND*NX), nrow=ND,ncol=NX) 
results.uweight    <- matrix(rep(-1.0, ND*NY), nrow=ND,ncol=NY) 
```

We are now ready to do the analysis.

```{r Store6-CRS}

RTS<-"CRS"
for (k in 1:ND) {
  
  result <- MIPModel()                                              |>
    add_variable(Vlambda[j], j = 1:ND, type = "continuous", 
                 lb = 0)                                            |>
    add_variable(Vtheta, type = "continuous")                       |>
    set_objective(Vtheta, "min")                                    |>
    add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * xdata[j,i], j = 1:ND) 
                   <= Vtheta * xdata[k,i], i = 1:NX)                |>
    add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * ydata[j,r], j = 1:ND) 
                   >= ydata[k,r], r = 1:NY) 

    if (RTS=="VRS") {result <- add_constraint(result, 
                 sum_expr(Vlambda[j],j = 1:ND) == 1) }  
  # Returns to Scale

results <-   solve_model(result, with_ROI(solver = "glpk")) 
    
    results.efficiency[k] <-  get_solution(results, Vtheta)       
    results.lambda[k,] <- t(as.matrix(as.numeric(
                     get_solution(results, Vlambda[j])[,3] )))
}
Store6CRS.Res<-cbind(results.efficiency, results.lambda)
Store6CRS.Eff<-results.efficiency 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
store6names <- TRA::DEAnames(NX, NY, ND)
rownames(Store6CRS.Res) <- store6names$DMUnamesbyletter

kbl (Store6CRS.Res, booktabs=T, escape=F, digits=4,
     col.names=c("$\\theta^{CRS}$", store6names$LambdanamesbyletterLX),

  add_header_above(c(" " = 1, "Efficiency" = 1, 
                     "Envelopment Variables" = 6))          |>
  kable_styling(latex_options = c("HOLD_position"))
```

The small, nearly zero, values that may appear in DEA calculations can cause some computational difficulty. For example, testing for zero lambda values could miss cases where the value is approximately but not exactly zero.

Let's compare the results from the constant and variable returns to scale cases.

```{r Store6-VRS}

RTS<-"VRS"
for (k in 1:ND) {
  
  result <- MIPModel()                                              |>
    add_variable(Vlambda[j], j = 1:ND, type = "continuous", 
                 lb = 0)                                            |>
    add_variable(Vtheta, type = "continuous")                       |>
    set_objective(Vtheta, "min")                                    |>
    add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * xdata[j,i], j = 1:ND) 
                   <= Vtheta * xdata[k,i], i = 1:NX)                |>
    add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * ydata[j,r], j = 1:ND) 
                   >= ydata[k,r], r = 1:NY) 

    if (RTS=="VRS") {result <- add_constraint(result, 
                 sum_expr(Vlambda[j],j = 1:ND) == 1) }  
  # Returns to Scale

results <-   solve_model(result, with_ROI(solver = "glpk")) 
    
    results.efficiency[k] <-  get_solution(results, Vtheta)       
    results.lambda[k,] <- t(as.matrix(as.numeric(
                     get_solution(results, Vlambda[j])[,3] )))
}
Store6VRS.Res<-cbind(results.efficiency, results.lambda)
Store6VRS.Eff<-results.efficiency
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
temp <- cbind(Store6CRS.Eff,Store6VRS.Eff)
rownames(temp)<- store6names$DMUnamesbyletter
kbl (temp, 
     booktabs=T, digits=5, escape=F,
     col.names=c("$\\theta^{CRS}$", "$\\theta^{VRS}$"),
     caption="Comparison of CRS vs. VRS Efficiency Scores")       |>
  kable_styling(latex_options = "HOLD_position")
```

A few takeaways from these results:

-   Switching from CRS to VRS will never hurt the efficiency of a DMU. From an optimization perspective, think of this as adding a constraint which will increase or leave unchanged the objective function value from a minimization linear program. makes it *easier* for a find

## Extracting Multiplier Weights from Envelopment Results

Recently, Dirk Schumacher added the option for the \index{Dual values!Extraction} extraction of dual results from glpk-solved linear programs. Let's now wrap this into the full series of linear programs so as to calculate the \index{Multiplier weights} multiplier weights for each unit in the CRS model.

```{r Store6-example-w-mult-weight}

RTS<-"CRS"
for (k in 1:ND) {
  
  result <- MIPModel()                                                |>
    add_variable(Vlambda[j], j = 1:ND, type = "continuous", 
                 lb = 0)                                              |>
    add_variable(Vtheta, type = "continuous")                         |>
    set_objective(Vtheta, "min")                                      |>
    add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * xdata[j,i], j = 1:ND) 
                   <= Vtheta * xdata[k,i], i = 1:NX)                  |>
    add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * ydata[j,r], j = 1:ND) 
                   >= ydata[k,r], r = 1:NY) 

    if (RTS=="VRS") {result <- add_constraint(result, 
                 sum_expr(Vlambda[j],j = 1:ND) == 1) }  
  # Returns to Scale

  result <- solve_model(result, with_ROI(solver = "glpk")) 
  results.efficiency[k] <-  get_solution(result, Vtheta)       
  results.lambda[k,] <- t(as.matrix(as.numeric(
    get_solution(result, Vlambda[j])[,3] )))
  rduals  <- as.matrix(get_row_duals(result))

  results.vweight[k,] <- -1*rduals[1:NX]
  results.uweight[k,] <- rduals[(NX+1):(NX+NY)]
  }
temp <- cbind (results.efficiency, results.lambda, 
               results.vweight, results.uweight)
rownames(temp) <- store6names$DMUnamesbyletter
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kbl (temp,booktabs=T, digits=5, escape=F,
     col.names=c("$\\theta^{CRS}$", store6names$LambdanamesbyletterLX,
                 store6names$VnamesLX, store6names$UnamesLX),
        caption="Results from Six Store Example")                       |>
  add_header_above(c(" "=1, "Efficiency" = 1, "Envelopment Variables" = 6,

kable_styling(protect_latex = TRUE, 
              latex_options = c("HOLD_position", "scale_down"))
```

A few things should be noticed with respect the the \index{Multiplier weights} multiplier weights:

-   Multiplier weights can be quite small because in general, they are multiplied by inputs and the product is typically less than one. They may appear to round to zero but still be significant.
-   Multiplier weights are not unique for strongly efficient DMUs. This is explored in more detail in the multiplier model chapter.
-   Multiplier weights are usually unique for inefficient DMUs and the results obtained using either the \index{Dual values!Row} row duals of the envelopment model or those obtained directly from the multiplier model should therefore typically match.

## Slack Maximization

\index{Slack|(}

Situations can arise where units may appear to be radially efficient but can still find opportunities to improve one or more inputs or outputs. This is defined as \index{Weakly efficient} weakly efficient.

### Numerical Example of Slack

First, let's add a new grocery store, Gary's Grocery, which is identical to the stellar Trader Carrie's except for using five extra staff members.

                     get_solution(results, Vlambda[j])[,3] )))

In this case, Gary's Grocery had an efficiency score, $\theta^{CRS}=1.0$ and was deemed efficient. Interestingly it did not use itself for comparison $\lambda_G=0.0$ and had its target formed based on Trader Carrie's, $\lambda_C=1.0$. This indicates that Gary's Grocery is radially efficient as no target can be made that allows for improving on *all* inputs. The radial efficiency scores may not reflect fully efficient operation.

```{r}
k<-7
result <- MIPModel()                                              |>

               lb = 0)                                            |>
  add_variable(Vtheta, type = "continuous")                       |>
  set_objective(Vtheta, "min")                                    |>
  add_constraint(Vlambda[3] ==0)                                  |>
       # constraint preventing the use of DMU 3 for Gary.
  add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * xdata[j,i], j = 1:ND) 
                 <= Vtheta * xdata[k,i], i = 1:NX)                |>
  add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * ydata[j,r], j = 1:ND) 
                 >= ydata[k,r], r = 1:NY) 
  if (RTS=="VRS") {result <- add_constraint(result, 
                 sum_expr(Vlambda[j],j = 1:ND) == 1) }  
  # Returns to Scale

results <-   solve_model(result, with_ROI(solver = "glpk")) 
    
    results.efficiency[k] <-  get_solution(results, Vtheta)       
    results.lambda[k,] <- t(as.matrix(as.numeric(
                     get_solution(results, Vlambda[j])[,3] )))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
rownames(Store7CRS.Res) <- store7names$DMUnamesbyletter

kable_styling(latex_option="HOLD_position")
```

Notice that this is an instance *multiple optimal solutions* or *multiple optima*. We can demonstrate this by simply adding a constraint that prevents at iteration 7 (Gary's Grocery) from having Trader Carrie's used in target setting ($\lambda_C=0$) will result in exactly the same efficiency score and thereby objective function value. We were lucky in this case to find a target that pointed initially to Trader Carrie's. In the case of multiple optima, finding a solution by luck is not a reliable procedure. We could have just as readily easily found Gary's Grocery to use itself as the comparator setting target using five extra workers than Trader Carrie's.

### Modeling to Account for Slacks

In order to accommodate this, we need to extend the simple radial model by adding variables to reflect nonradial slacks. We do this by converting the model's \index{Constraints!Input} input and \index{Constraints!Output} output constraints from inequalities into equalities by explicitly defining slack variables. The slack variable(s) $s^x_i$ represents the amount of input, *i*, can be reduced from the target for the analysis. Similarly, the slack variable(s) $s^y_r$ indicate the additional amount of output r which the target is able to generate. These are considered non-radial slacks and are above and beyond the proportional inefficiency indicated by $\theta$

$$
\begin{split}
 \begin{aligned}
    \text{minimize  }   & \theta \\
    \text{subject to } & \sum_{j=1}^{N^D} x_{i,j}\lambda_j - \theta x_{i,k} + s^x_i = 0 \; \forall \; i\\
                       & \sum_{j=1}^{N^D} y_{r,j}\lambda_j - s^y_r =  y_{r,k} \; \forall \; r\\
                       & \lambda_j , s^x_i, s^y_r \geq 0  \; \forall \; j,i,r
 \end{aligned}
\end{split}
$$

Simply formulating the model with slacks is insufficient. We want to maximize these slacks after having found the best possible radial contraction (minimum value of $\theta$.) This is done by adding a term summing the slacks to the objective function. Note that this sum of slacks is multiplied by $\epsilon$ which is a non-Archimedean infinitesimal. The value of $\epsilon$ should be considered to be so small as to ensure that minimizing $\theta$ takes priority or maximizing the sum of slacks. Note also that maximizing the sum of slacks is denoted by minimizing the negative sum of slacks.

$$
\begin{split}
 \begin{aligned}
    \text{minimize  }   & \theta - \epsilon ( \sum_{i} s^x_i + \sum_{r} s^y_r)\\
    \text{subject to } & \sum_{j=1}^{N^D} x_{i,j}\lambda_j - \theta x_{i,k} + s^x_i = 0 \forall \; i\\
                       & \sum_{j=1}^{N^D} y_{r,j}\lambda_j - s^y_r =  y_{r,k} \forall \; r\\
                       & \lambda_j , s^x_i, s^y_r \geq 0  \; \forall \; j,i,r
  \end{aligned}
 \end{split}
$$

A common mistake in implementing DEA is to use a finite approximation for $\epsilon$ such as $10^{-6}$. Any finite value can cause distortions in $\theta$. For example, an application comparing companies using revenue and expenses might have inputs and outputs on the order of millions or billions. In this case, non-radial slacks could also be on the order of $10^{6}$. Multiplying the two results in a value similar in magnitude to the maximum possible efficiency score ($10^{-6}\cdot 10^{6}=1$) which would then potentially overwhelm the radial efficiency, $\theta$, part of the objective function and lead to distorted results.

The proper way to implement slack maximization is to treat it as a preemptive \index{Goal programming} goal programming problem. The primary goal is to minimize $\theta$ in a first phase linear program and the second goal, holding the level of $\theta$ fixed from the first phase, is to then maximize the sum of the slacks.

The first phase can take the form of any of our earlier linear programs without the $\epsilon$ and sum of slacks in the objective function. The second phase is the following where $\theta^*$ is the optimal value from phase one and $\theta$ is then held constant in the second phase. This is formulated by adding a constraint, $\theta=\theta^*$ to the second phase linear program.

$$
\begin{split}
 \begin{aligned}
    \text{max   } & \sum_{i}s^x_i + \sum_{r}s^y_r\\
    \text{s.t.: } & \sum_{j=1}^{N^D} \lambda_j  = 1\\
                  & \sum_{j=1}^{N^D} x_{i,j}\lambda_j - \theta x_{i,k} + s^x_i = 0 \; \forall \; i\\
                  & \sum_{j=1}^{N^D} y_{r,j}\lambda_j - s^y_r =  y_{r,k} \; \forall \; r\\
                  & \theta = \theta^*\\
                  & \lambda_j , s^x_i, s^y_r \geq 0  \; \forall \; j,i,r
  \end{aligned}
\end{split}
$$

### Implementing the Slack Maximization Approach

Implementing this algebraically is quite straightforward. The code is provided below but it is easy to get lost in the code.

The key steps are that after setting up and solving the model, we read in the Phase 1 objective function value

`phase1obj <-  get_solution(result, Vtheta)`

We then constrain variable `Vtheta` to that value in Phase 2.

`add_constraint(LPSlack, Vtheta==phase1obj)`

Lastly, we change the objective function to maximize the sum of slacks.

`set_objective(LPSlack, sum_expr(xslack[i], i=1:NX)+sum_expr(yslack[r], r=1:NY), "max")`

We can then solve the model again.

```{r Slack-max}
results.xslack    <- matrix(rep(-1.0, ND*NX), nrow=ND,ncol=NX) 
results.yslack    <- matrix(rep(-1.0, ND*NY), nrow=ND,ncol=NY) 

RTS<-"CRS"
for (k in 1:ND) {
  
  LPSlack <- MIPModel()                                             |>
    add_variable(Vlambda[j], j = 1:ND, type = "continuous", lb = 0) |>
    add_variable(Vtheta, type = "continuous")                       |>
    add_variable(xslack[i], i = 1:NX, type = "continuous", lb = 0)  |>
    add_variable(yslack[r], r = 1:NY, type = "continuous", lb = 0)  |>
    
    set_objective(Vtheta, "min")                                    |>
    
    add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * xdata[j,i], 
                            j = 1:ND)+xslack[i] 
                   - Vtheta * xdata[k,i]==0, i = 1:NX)              |>
    
    add_constraint(sum_expr(Vlambda[j] * ydata[j,r], 
                            j = 1:ND) -yslack[r]
                    ==ydata[k,r], r = 1:NY) 
  
    result1 <-   solve_model(LPSlack, with_ROI(solver = "glpk")) 

    # The following are the key steps to slack maximization 
    phase1obj <-  get_solution(result1, Vtheta)  
    # Get Phase 1 objective value

    LPSlack<-add_constraint(LPSlack, Vtheta==phase1obj)   
                     # Passing result from phase 1 to phase 2
    
    LPSlack<-set_objective(LPSlack, sum_expr(xslack[i], i=1:NX)
                  + sum_expr(yslack[r], r=1:NY), "max")
              # Modify the objective function for phase 2
    result2 <-   solve_model(LPSlack, with_ROI(solver = "glpk")) 
    results.efficiency[k] <-  get_solution(result2, Vtheta)       
    results.lambda[k,] <- t(as.matrix(
                 as.numeric(get_solution(result2, 
                                         Vlambda[.])[,3] )))
    results.xslack[k,]  <- t(as.matrix(
                 as.numeric(get_solution(result2, 
                                         xslack[.])[,3] )))
    results.yslack[k,]  <- t(as.matrix(
                 as.numeric(get_solution(result2, 
                                         yslack[.])[,3] )))
    }

Store7SlackMax.Res<-cbind(results.efficiency, results.lambda, 
                          results.xslack, results.yslack)
rownames(Store7SlackMax.Res) <- store7names$DMUnamesbyletter
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
kbl (Store7SlackMax.Res, booktabs=T, escape=F, digits=3,
     col.names=c("$\\theta^{CRS}$", store7names$LambdanamesbyletterLX,

kable_styling(latex_options="HOLD_position")
```

The results indicate the presence of non-radial slacks in stores B, F, and G. Not only can B's efficiency be improved by using 16.7% less of every input, the first input can be further reduced by 4.667. A simple focus on just radial efficiency score, $\theta$ will understate the potential for improved operations.

These results that store G (Gary's Grocery) is radially efficient, $\theta=1$, and therefore can't make a reduction in all inputs simultaneously while still producing the same level of output. On the other hand, the value $s_1^x=5$ indicates a reduction of the first input can still be done.

The total slacks may be thought of as the difference between the best target and the actual inputs and outputs of the units studied.

To do the challenges, work on extending my RMarkdown file or using a similar script. You can use my file as a starting point. You can access it from the github repository, [Chapter 2 Rmd from github](https://github.com/prof-anderson/DEA_Using_R/blob/master/02-IO_Env.Rmd). Note that running this file may require subdirectories such as `images` or `generated-images` to display graphics.

You can use other packages for graphics or data manipulation but don't use a DEA package. (Don't worry, we'll get there later.)
